# Body-Mass-Index-Calculator
This was my first time using a graphical user interface for the Java language. To be able to run this program you must use Java SE 8 because Oracle discontinued Applet support for Java SE 11. Programmed on NetBeans IDE.
Calculates the measure of fat based on height and weight and states if a person is relatively healthy or not.
